                <p>Cape Town–based artist Cinga Samson, who’s known for surreal portraits that lionize African and diasporic figures, didn’t always plan on becoming a painter. As a child, he wanted to pursue a career in nature conservation. At age 20, however, he stumbled upon a shared studio in Cape Town where three artists—Gerald Tabata, Xolile Mtakatya, and Lutahando Laphuwano—were hard at work painting. He knew he had come across something remarkable. Though Samson spent his childhood in the small South African town of Ethembeni deeply engaged in drawing, he grew up with no model for what life as a visual artist might look like.</p>
